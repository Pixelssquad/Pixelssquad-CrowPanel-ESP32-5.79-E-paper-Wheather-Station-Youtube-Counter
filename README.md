# Pixelssquad-CrowPanel-ESP32-5.79-E-paper-Wheather-Station-Youtube-Counter

I present to you the esp32 E-Paper module by Elecrow, it is a 5.72 inch with a resolution of 293x272 pixels.

Starting from the example of a weather station that is reported in the official repository, I made this new program by adding the subscriber counter to your YouTube channel

Official Repo: https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/CrowPanel-ESP32-5.79-E-paper-HMI-Display-with-272-792

Documentation: https://www.elecrow.com/wiki/CrowPanel_ESP32_E-paper_5.79-inch_HMI_Display.html

In addition to the necessary libraries found in the official repu I used YoutubeApi.h by 2020 Brian Lough: https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-youtube-api I included them in this repo for maximum compatibility.
